# runtime/manager

The local Runtime Manager. Keeps the desktop installer light and installs the
scientific environment on demand.

Responsibilities:

- Detect OpenCode, Python / uv, Node, Git.
- Create and manage the workspace and per-project isolated environments.
- Install base Python packages and scientific tool dependencies on demand.
- Start / supervise the bundled OpenCode sidecar (and later the Jupyter Kernel Gateway).
- Manage ports; monitor runtime health.
- Write `provenance.jsonl`; collect logs.

## Runtime directory (per OS)

```text
macOS app data:
  ~/Library/Application Support/io.github.shawliu998.sparkagent/runtime/

Windows app data:
  Tauri per-user app-data/io.github.shawliu998.sparkagent/runtime/

default workspaces:
  ~/Documents/SparkAgent/<dated-session>/
```

The runtime root contains the isolated OpenCode XDG config, data, cache, and
state directories. The workspace base is user-selectable and is not a secrets
directory.

## Startup order

UI starts first → Runtime Manager checks dependencies → starts the OpenCode sidecar →
connects → loads projects. A failed OpenCode connection must not block the UI.
